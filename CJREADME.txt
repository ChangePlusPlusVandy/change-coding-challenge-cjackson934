twitter_game README

Before working on this project, I had never worked with python or any web APIs. It was a big learning curve for me, but I really enjoyed learning some new tools. I chose to use the tweepy API to retrieve and filter through all the tweets. To run my program, you will need to enter your own secret keys.

My program runs in a python console and allows for the user to input for any two twitter handles.
A tweet is randomly selected from either of the two twitter users, and the player can guess between the users. When the user is done playing, some game statistics and a funny message are displayed.

If I had more time, I would have added more exception handling in case of faulty input from the user, or trouble retrieving the tweets. It also would be fun to get this working in a web app development complete with buttons and text input boxes so it is more user friendly and appealing. I also spent a great deal of time trying to reduce the performance time for retrieving 6400 tweets, but this was the most effective solution I could reach in the time I had.
